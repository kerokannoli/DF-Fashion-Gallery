This image collection was originally updated by FeatheryWings until 2019. I took it upon myself to try and update the guide to the best of my ability, and will do so whenever I have enough free time. I recommend downloading this as a folder so you can easily view everything with thumbnails.
Ideally I'll update this whenever new items are released, but if not, they'll likely come in batches. Thank you for your patience and happy fashion hunting!

For feedback and missing items, contact me on Discord: kerokannoli#1328

Additional Notes
----
-Any naming inconsistencies ie. (Temp), (Animated), (Click To Change) (Has many forms) etc will occur with recent additions.
-Some items like Ultimate/Laggy Doom Dragon Scythe of the Elements are considered rare unless they get re-released again.
-Current excluded items are a few weapons in Lim's shop, which I don't find worthy to add. There are probably many excluded Book 1 items as well.
-I'm trying not to remove FeatheryWings' additions even if I find something that's subjectively ugly as they originally found them worthy of being included in the repository.
